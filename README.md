# Chariots

Chariots is a framework for building versioned machine learning pipelines. it aims at bringing cementic versioning to most machine learning framework (sci-kit learn, keras, tensorflow, pytorch, â€¦).

The main idea of ths framwork is to be able to deprecate models basedf on the evolution of the piepline they are integrated into and eventually (this is very much a work in progress) monitor easilly the performance impact of various changes made to a pipeline.

## Installing

this repo is not available on pypi for now so you will have to install it manually

```
git clone https://github.com/aredier/chariots.git
cd chariots
pip install .
```

## Getting started

Chariots revolves around ops to build pipeline. 

here is an example of an Op:

```python
from chariots.core.ops import BaseOp
from chariots.core import requirements

MyCustomMarker = markers.Number.new_marker()

class MyFirstOp(BaseOp):
    name = "first_chariot_op"
    requires = {"input_data": markers.Matrix((10))}
    markers = [MyCustomMarker()]
    
    def _main(self, input_data):
        return sum(input_data)
```



here is what happened

- specify the requirements of your Op (here a Matrix for instance). this will mark what needs to be in the data for the op to work
- specify your op's marker: This will marked the data produced by this op (and be used by down stream ops' requirements 
- define your ops behavior in the `_main` method:

in order to make your op run you need perform it on data. In order to do this we link the op to a `DataTap` instance

```python
from chariots.core.taps import DataTap
my_data = [list(range(10)) for _ in range(5)]
tap = DataTap(iter(my_data), markers.Matrix((10)))
op = MyFirstOp()
result = op(tap)
```

here we have initilized the tap with an iterator and a `Marker` 

we can then check the output

```python
for individual_result in result.perform():
    print(individual_result[op.markers[0]])
```

here we can see that the results will be a dictionnary with the marker of the data outputed as keys and the results as value 



### versioning

if you want some field of your op to be versioned, you can simply add it as `VersionedField`:

```python
from chariots.core.ops import BaseOp
from chariots.core import requirements
from chariots.core import versioning

MyCustomMarker = markers.Number.new_marker()

class MyFirstVersionedOp(BaseOp):
    name = "first_chariot_op"
    requires = {"input_data": markers.Matrix((10))}
    markers = [MyCustomMarker()]
    my_versioned_field = versioning.VersionField(versioning.VersionType.MAJOR,
                                                 default="hello world")
    def main(self, input_data):
        return self.my_versioned_field
```



### trainable op

In order to build a trainable op (that represents a model), you can either inherit from `TrainableOp` in a similar way as above exemples or use a factory in one of the `training` submodules:

```python
from chariots.training import sklearn

naive_baise = sklearn.SingleFitSkTransformer.factory(
	x_marker=TextList(),
	model_cls=CountVectorizer,
	y_marker=TextVector(()),
	name="count_vectorizer"
)
```



## Running the tests

to run the tests you can simply run 

```
py.test test/
```
